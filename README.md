# Demo-Server
This is a demo of a server running in Python. This demo allows you to connect from your PC to the server and share or send information between PCs. The definition of "server" is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the "client." In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.
